\begin{cvsection}{Research Experience}
    \cvitem{Socially Assistive Robot for Upper Extremity Telerehab}{University of Pennsylvania, Rehabilitation Robotics Laboratory}{Philadelphia, PA }{Aug 2016}{present}{
    Developing an affordable socially assistive robot to aid in telepresence based assessment and treatment of patients with upper extremity motor impairments as a tool to expand the reach of clinicians while improving the objectivity of diagnostic tools.
The project involves two primary foci 1) understanding how patients react to telepresence robots which incorporate social robots and how that affects remote assessment and 2) developing a framework for identifying motor function from video of a patient doing various robot guided activities.

This work is being extended to address challenges in patient care related to COVID-19.

    \cvitem{Edge-Based Tracking for Flexible Manufacturing}{Georgia Institute of Technology, IRIM Technology Transition Laboratory}{Atlanta, GA}{Aug 2015}{Jun 2016}{Worked as an Undergraduate Researcher (Aug 2015 -- Dec 2015) and Research Technician II (Dec 2015 -- Jun 2016) under Dr.\ Henrik Christensen and Dr.\ Larry Sweet to advance technologies in the visual servoing space, explicitly focused on potential industry applications. Refined an existing video based real-time textureless tracker from a research code base to a well documented robust system capable of running at \(30+\) fps at \(1920\times1080\) pixels, to enable manipulation on non-fixed, non-located car parts at a client automotive facility, resulting in successful demonstrations to management. Utilized heavy industrial robots while developing perception, calibration, and control systems in C++ and Python. }

\begin{cvsection}{Research Experience}
    \cvitem{Socially Assistive Robot for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation}{University of Pennsylvania, Rehabilitation Robotics Laboratory}{Philadelphia, PA }{Aug 2016}{present}{Developing an affordable socially assistive robot to aid in remote, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous assessment and treatment of patients with upper extremity impairments as a tool to expand the reach of clinicians while improving the objectivity of diagnostic tools. The project involves two primary foci 1) understanding how to make robots that are affordable while still being effective at conveying emotional information and giving directions and 2) developing a framework for identifying motor function from video of a patient doing various robot guided activities.}

    \cvitem{Edge-Based Tracking for Flexible Manufacturing}{Georgia Institute of Technology, IRIM Technology Transition Laboratory}{Atlanta, GA}{Aug 2015}{June 2016}{Worked as an Undergraduate Researcher (Aug 2015 -- Dec 2015) and Research Technician II (Dec 2015 -- June 2016) under Dr.\ Henrik Christensen and Dr.\ Larry Sweet to advance technologies in the visual servoing space, explicitly focused on potential industry applications. Refined an existing video based real-time textureless tracker from a research code base to a well documented robust system capable of running at \(30+\) fps at \(1920\times1080\) pixels, to enable manipulation on non-fixed, non-located car parts at a client automotive facility, resulting in successful demonstrations to management. Utilized heavy industrial robots while developing perception, calibration, and control systems in C++ and Python. }

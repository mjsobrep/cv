\begin{cvsection}{Research Experience}
    \cvitem{Socially Assistive Robot for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation}{University of Pennsylvania, Rehabilitation Robotics Laboratory}{Philadelphia, PA }{Aug 2016}{present}{Primary work towards PhD thesis. Working under Dr. Michelle Johnson to develop an affordable socially assistive robot to aid in remote, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous assessment and treatment of patients with upper extremity impairments as a tool to expand the reach of clinicians while improving the objectivity of diagnostic tools. The project involves two primary focusses 1) understanding how to make robots that are affordable while still being effective at conveying emotional information and giving directions and 2) developing a framework for identifying motor function from video of a patient doing various robot guided activities.}

    \cvitem{Edge-Based Tracking for Flexible Manufacturing}{Georgia Institute of Technology, IRIM Technology Transition Laboratory}{Atlanta, GA}{Aug 2015}{June 2016}{Worked as an Undergraduate Researcher (Aug 2015 - Dec 2015) and Research Technician II (Dec 2015 - June 2016) under Dr. Henrik Christensen and Dr. Larry Sweet to advance technologies in the visual servoing space, explicitly focused on potential industry applications. Lead researcher on Edge-Based Tracking project for PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n, the refinement of a video based real-time textureless tracker which uses edges found in the video, corresponding to edges in a 3D mesh, tracked over time, to enable manipulation on non-fixed, non-located targets manufacturing applications. Utilized heavy industrial robots while developing perception, calibration, and control systems in C++ and Python. }

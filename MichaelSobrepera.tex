\section*{Summary}
\hspace*{\fill}\begin{minipage}{\textwidth-\cvindent}
I am a project leader, full stack roboticist, AI practitioner, and in general a problem solver.
I have an array of hard skills across design, hardware, software, and algorithms, complemented by strong data analysis, experimental design, team leadership, stakeholder management, and communication skills, allowing me to enter new project spaces, rapidly gain domain knowledge, go deep into problems, and manage complicated stakeholder dynamics to generate answers and solutions. 
%My work focuses on understanding how social robots can be used to enhance telerehabilitation and how computer vision can be used for motor assessment. 
%I am funded under an NIH F31 Pre-Doctoral Fellowship. 
I am passionate about learning, working on meaningful problems, pushing the boundaries of technology, and mentoring the next generation.
